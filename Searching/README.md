# Searching Algorithms

 Searching is a process of finding a particular element among several given elements

---

## What's Included

### [Linear Search](/Searching/Linear_Search.c)

- Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm. It traverses the array sequentially to locate the required element.
- Time Complexity of Linear Search Algorithm is O(n).

### [Binary Search](/Searching/Binary_Search.c)

- Binary Search is one of the fastest searching algorithms. It is used for finding the location of an element in a sorted array using divide and conquer technique.
- Time Complexity of Binary Search Algorithm is O(logn).
