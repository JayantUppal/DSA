# Searching Algorithms

 Searching is a process of finding a particular element among several given elements

---

## What's Included

### Linear Search

- Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm. It traverses the array sequentially to locate the required element.
- Time Complexity of Linear Search Algorithm is O(n).

### Binary Search

- Binary Search is one of the fastest searching algorithms. It is used for finding the location of an element in a sorted array using divide and conquer technique.
- Time Complexity of Binary Search Algorithm is O(logn).
